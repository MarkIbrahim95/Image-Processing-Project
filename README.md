# Image Processing Project (Describe my photo)
 Mechatronics Major

## Project Description:
The idea of this project is to generate a paragraph describing a photo using a combination of image processing and deep learning algorithm. This module may be useful in many domains. In medical domains, it may help scanning doctors to provide more accurate descriptions about their scans. In search engines, generating a paragraph describing the image makes the search process more robust rather than relying only on the uploader caption.
